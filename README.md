Who are your stakeholders?
  Small Women-owned, and Minority-owned Businesses
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) + Government Entities
  Environmental Advocacy Organizations
  Policy Makers + general public


What problem are you trying to solve for the stakeholders?
  Over the last three years, how have EPA contract funds been distributed across industries, and which have gone up or down? What trends exist in this funding? 
  How can we use this information to help small, women, and minority-owned businesses get more EPA contracts?

  
How will you solve the problem? 
  Data Collection: Gather historical data on EPA contract funds distributed across industries over the last three years. This data should include information on the amount of funding allocated to each industry, the types of contracts awarded, and any relevant demographic information about the businesses receiving contracts.

  Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to identify trends in EPA contract funding distribution across industries over the past three years. This analysis can involve statistical techniques such as trend analysis, regression analysis, and data visualization methods to identify patterns and trends in the data.

  Develop Strategies: Based on the analysis , develop strategies to support small, women, and minority-owned businesses in accessing EPA contracts. These strategies may include targeted outreach and support programs, capacity-building initiatives, policy advocacy efforts, and partnerships with government agencies and environmental advocacy organizations.
